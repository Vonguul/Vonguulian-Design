# Authority in Human Design: Making Aligned Decisions

## Your Inner Authority—The Compass Within

Human Design offers a revolutionary approach to decision-making: instead of relying on your mind or logic alone, you have an Inner Authority—a built-in compass that guides you toward decisions aligned with your true nature.

Your Inner Authority varies based on your energetic design and is your most reliable decision-making tool.

## Types of Authority

### Emotional Authority
The most common form. Decisions require emotional clarity and time. Emotions provide the signal through emotional waves; honor the process of moving through your feelings.

**How it works:** Decisions made in emotional clarity—after the wave passes—are aligned. Decisions made in emotional intensity often need revisiting.

### Sacral Authority
Unique to Generators and Manifesting Generators. Your gut carries the wisdom; respond with "yes" or "no" body responses.

**How it works:** Notice your instinctive physical response. A deep yes or no from your body is your authority.

### Spleen Authority
Intuitive and present-moment knowing. The spleen speaks in whispers; you must be present to hear it.

**How it works:** Immediate instinctive knowing that arises in the present moment. Trust the immediate, first response.

### Heart/Will Authority
Less common. Your willpower and commitment are the authority. Move with what you're committed to creating.

**How it works:** Your determination and will to create something is the deciding factor. Follow what you're willing to fight for.

### Lunar Authority
For Reflectors specifically. Decisions require the full lunar cycle—29.5 days of reflection.

**How it works:** Check in with a lunar cycle decision (wait 29 days) to see if you're still aligned with it.

### No Inner Authority/Mental Projection
Very rare. You're meant to discuss and bounce ideas off others before deciding. Use trusted advisors.

**How it works:** Articulating your thoughts to someone helps you arrive at clarity.

## Living by Your Authority

When you make decisions through your Inner Authority:
- Decisions feel right and remain right over time
- You avoid buyer's remorse and second-guessing
- You move with your natural energetic timing
- Life becomes easier and more satisfying

## The Mind's Role

Your mind is NOT your authority. Your mind is a beautiful tool for analysis and understanding, but not for decision-making in your daily life. Honoring your Authority is the key to living in alignment.
