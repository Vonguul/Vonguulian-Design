# Centers, Channels & Gates: The Energy Body Explained

## The Energetic Architecture of Your Design

Beyond Type and Authority lies a complex map of your energetic body. Centers, Channels, and Gates form the infrastructure of your unique design—they represent the ways energy flows through you and the specific gifts and challenges encoded in your blueprint.

## The Nine Centers

Your energy body contains nine centers, each representing a different domain of human experience:

### The Head Center

- Receives inspiration and mental pressure

**Themes:** Processing, conceptualizing, belief systems

### The Throat Center
**Themes:** Communication, manifestation, expression

## Channels: The Connections

Channels connect two centers and represent specific themes and energetic flows. Where you have channels, energy flows naturally; where you don't, that's potential waiting to be activated by others.

## Gates: The Doorways

Gates are the 64 points of entry into your design—they represent specific qualities and gifts. Each gate has a theme, and where your gates are activated, those themes show up in your life naturally.

## Defined vs. Undefined

**Defined Centers & Channels:** Consistent, reliable energy flow. These are your gifts and consistent ways of operating.

**Undefined Centers & Channels:** Fluid, variable, and open to others' energy. These are your learning areas and where you're designed to be influenced by others.
