# The Four Types: Manifestor, Generator, MG, Projector, Reflector

## The Five Human Design Types

Human Design recognizes five distinct types, each with their own energy signature and life strategy. Understanding which type you are is fundamental to living in alignment.

### Manifestor (About 8% of population)

Manifestors are the initiators and action-takers. They possess a unique closed aura and carry their own internal energy.

**Key characteristics:**
- Powerful initiators of action
- Impact-oriented
- Independent energy
- Sometimes misunderstood as aggressive

**Strategy:** To inform before acting. When Manifestors inform others about their intentions first, resistance dissolves and their initiatives flow smoothly.

### Generator (About 37% of population)

Generators are the workers and builders. They have powerful, sustainable energy and are designed to work on what brings them satisfaction and joy.

**Key characteristics:**
- Respond to opportunities
- Built for sustainable work
- Generate life force through engagement
- Seek satisfaction in their work

**Strategy:** To respond to life. Generators thrive when they respond to opportunities rather than chase them. Their Strategy is to wait for the right energetic match.

### Manifesting Generator (About 10% of population)

Manifesting Generators combine Manifestor initiation with Generator response. They're faster-moving and more flexible than pure Generators.

**Key characteristics:**
- Multi-talented and versatile
- Fast decision-makers
- Can initiate but also respond
- Energetically unpredictable

**Strategy:** To inform before acting AND respond. They inform to smooth their path, then move quickly when opportunities arise.

### Projector (About 20% of population)

Projectors are guides, strategists, and systems understanders. They see how things fit together and work best when invited into roles that value their insights.

**Key characteristics:**
- Natural strategic thinkers
- See systems and patterns
- Thrive on being recognized and invited
- Limited but focused energy

**Strategy:** To wait for an invitation. Projectors invited into situations experience ease; when they push without invitation, they face resistance.

### Reflector (About 1% of population)

Reflectors are mirrors of their environment. They are profoundly sensitive to the energetic environment around them and are designed as a check on collective health.

**Key characteristics:**
- Highly sensitive to environment
- Mirror collective energy
- Designed to evaluate group dynamics
- Require lunar-cycle decision-making

**Strategy:** To take 29 days (lunar cycle) to make important decisions. This protects Reflectors from environment-influenced choices and allows them to reflect accurately.

## Finding Your Type

Your Human Design chart reveals your Type immediately. Once you know your Type, you can begin operating with your Strategy—the most direct path to decision-making ease and life satisfaction.
