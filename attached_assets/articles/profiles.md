# Profiles: The Specific Role You Play in Life

## Your Life Role and Evolutionary Purpose

While your Type defines *how* you operate, your Profile defines *the role you play* in your life and in the world. Your Profile is a combination of two numbers that creates one of 12 unique archetypal roles.

## What Is Profile?

Profile comes from combining two elements in your chart:
- **Line number from your Conscious Sun** (your conscious, known self)
- **Line number from your Unconscious Sun** (your unconscious, hidden gifts)

This creates a two-number combination (like 1/3, 4/6, 5/2) that represents your specific evolutionary role.

## The Twelve Profiles

### Profile 1 - The Investigator
Deep research and investigation of a specific domain. Naturally studies to gain mastery and understanding.

### Profile 2 - The Hermit
Natural hermit wisdom; learns through solitude and personal experience, then shares naturally with those who come seeking.

### Profile 3 - The Martyr
Learns through experience and experimentation. Trial and error is the path; wisdom comes from lived experience.

### Profile 4 - The Opportunist
Naturally connected to others; opportunities arise through relationships. Success through timing and personal connections.

### Profile 5 - The Heretic
Naturally attracts projection; others see them as holding answers. Designed to be called upon and to help others find their own truth.

### Profile 6 - The Role Model
Life lessons come through experience early, then wisdom sharing with others in later years. Three-stage life progression.

## How Profile Shapes Your Life

Your Profile reveals:
- **Your natural role** in families, workplaces, and communities
- **How you're meant to contribute** your unique gifts
- **The timing of your life evolution**
- **How you attract and engage with others**

## Living Your Profile

Understanding your Profile helps you:
- Accept your unique role with confidence
- Stop trying to be something you're not
- Recognize how you naturally attract opportunities
- Understand relationship and community dynamics

Your Profile is your evolutionary assignment in this lifetime—when you embrace it fully, life becomes effortless and purposeful.
