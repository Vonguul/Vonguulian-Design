# Understanding Your Human Design Type

## The Foundation of Human Design

Human Design is a system that decodes your personal operating manual. At its core lies your Type—the fundamental way you're designed to interact with the world and make decisions.

Your Type is one of five categories: Manifestor, Generator, Manifesting Generator, Projector, or Reflector. This isn't about personality; it's about the energetic mechanics that define how you naturally operate.

## The Five Types Explained

### Your Unique Blueprint

Each type carries specific qualities:
- **Energy dynamics**: How you naturally generate or attract energy
- **Decision-making authority**: Your unique way of making aligned choices
- **Life strategy**: The optimal approach for how you move through life
- **Role in society**: How you're designed to contribute to collective energy

## Why Type Matters

Understanding your Type is the first step to living in alignment. When you operate according to your design, you experience:
- Greater ease and flow in decision-making
- Increased vitality and life force
- More authentic relationships and interactions
- A sense of purpose and rightness in your life direction
