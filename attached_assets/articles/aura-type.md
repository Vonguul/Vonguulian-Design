# Your Aura Type & Its Impact on Your Life

## The Energetic Signature That Precedes You

Your aura is your energetic signature—the energetic field that surrounds you and broadcasts your presence to the world before you speak a word. In Human Design, aura type directly reflects your Type and fundamentally shapes how you interact with others and how they perceive you.

## Understanding Aura Types

Each Human Design Type has a distinct aura with specific qualities:

### The Closed Aura (Manifestor)
- **Characteristic:** Energy is contained and internal
- **Effect:** Others feel approached by you, not the other way around
- **Interaction:** You must inform others; they won't naturally understand your intentions
- **Impact:** Can seem distant or mysterious until intentions are clarified

### The Open Aura (Projector)
- **Characteristic:** Energy radiates outward; highly receptive to others' energy
- **Effect:** Others feel your attention and interest immediately
- **Interaction:** You naturally see and understand others
- **Impact:** Can be energetically drained if not boundaried; highly influential

### The Enveloping/Environmental Aura (Generator & Manifesting Generator)
- **Characteristic:** Energy wraps around and creates an environment
- **Effect:** People are drawn into your space; you create atmosphere
- **Interaction:** Your presence changes the energy of situations
- **Impact:** You're designed to engage and involve others in your energy

### The Sampling Aura (Reflector)
- **Characteristic:** Energy samples and reflects the environment
- **Effect:** Highly attuned to others' energy and collective dynamics
- **Interaction:** You mirror back what you perceive
- **Impact:** You feel everything; protection through awareness is essential

## How Aura Type Affects Relationships

Your aura type determines:
- **How you attract partners:** Open auras attract differently than closed auras
- **Communication style:** How naturally you're understood
- **Energy dynamics:** Who energizes or drains you
- **Social patterns:** Why certain situations feel effortless or difficult

## Recognizing Your Aura in Action

Pay attention to:
- How people respond to your presence
- The patterns in your relationships
- Whether you feel energized or drained in different contexts
- How others describe the impact of being around you

Your aura is constantly broadcasting. Understanding it helps you work with this natural transmission rather than against it.
